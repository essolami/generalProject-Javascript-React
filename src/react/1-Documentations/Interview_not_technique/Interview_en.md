[ Introduce yourself? ]()

Hello, I am Hamza Essolami, a graduate of the Higher School of Technology in Computer Science. For the past three years, I've worked as a frontend developer, and I'm passionate about creating beautiful, high-performance products that deliver a great user experience.

Currently, I work at Barexia, where I have carried out several interesting projects. I am also responsible for managing back office resources as well as front office for a major project called Bam Music, a music streaming site similar to Spotify, where users can listen, download and purchase music licenses.

My tasks include converting design to code and managing the various APIs. As a team lead, I am responsible for assigning tasks and reviewing code, as well as communicating directly with the product owner to understand the tasks at hand.

Outside of my job, I have a passion for creativity and am also a painter and theater actor. Thank you for this opportunity to share my experiences and passions with you.

[ Why do you want to quit your current job ]()

I am currently satisfied with my work at Barexia and I feel very lucky to work on interesting projects, such as Bam Music.

However, I am also open to opportunities for professional growth and developing my skills in a different work environment.

If I were to consider leaving my current job, it would be because I would be looking to take on new challenges and explore broader career opportunities in the industry.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth, so if the opportunity arises, I am ready to consider all options that could provide me with a rewarding professional experience.

[ What is your greatest professional achievement? ]()

I can give you an example of professional success different from my experience with Bam Music.

In my previous professional experience, I worked on a project for an e-commerce company to improve the user experience on their website. My job was to improve the page load speed, as well as optimize the functionality to provide a smoother and more enjoyable experience for users.

After identifying the areas for improvement, I worked with a team of developers to implement the necessary changes, while respecting the deadlines and the budget. The result was remarkable: the speed of loading pages was considerably improved, and users were able to navigate the site more easily.

As a result, the company experienced a significant increase in conversion rate, as well as a reduction in bounce rate. This professional success has given me new skills in performance optimization and project management, and it has been very satisfying for me as an IT professional.

[ Tell me about your technical skills. ? ]()

As a Front-End developer, I developed strong technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS.

I have hands-on experience using HTML and CSS to create complex and responsive layouts, while ensuring a pleasant and intuitive user experience.

Also, I am very comfortable with JavaScript frameworks such as React JS. I have a good understanding of React concepts, such as Redux to manage stores, I am able to apply them effectively to create high-performance and scalable applications. as well as I have already worked on small projects with angular! but for the moment I am very comfortable with React Js

Finally, I am also able to work with development tools such as Git, npm, webpack and Babel to ensure efficient management of source code and development workflows. I like to stay up to date with the latest technologies and web trends, which allows me to continue to develop my technical skills all the time.

I am willing to discuss my salary expectations, taking into account my previous compensation, knowledge and experience in the industry. On this basis, I consider that a salary between 30,000 and 40,000 euros gross per year would be reasonable for a Front End React JS Junior position in France. However, I am also open to negotiation for other forms of compensation available.
